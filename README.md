Mini Challenge 4, Eight to Ten

Peer Review: 
8ball: Nice use of a switch statement! I used an array in mine, but I think the switch statement looks cleaner.
Number Guess: Your code is nice, but I don't see any data validation to ensure the user is entering a number. It would be cool to see what the correct number was after you guess incorrectly.
Restaurant Picker: I like the way you formatted your return line for the random index of stringArray, that's clever. I think they wanted us to do this one with only one endpoint though. I also noticed that the word Restaurant is misspelled in your function names and your route names. It took me a minute to troubleshoot that endpoint on Postman. I wouldn't want to see you lose points if one of the TA's had a hard time accessing that endpoint while grading your work just because of a spelling error. It would also be nice to have you output an interpolated string like "Your random restaurant is Moo Moo's!" rather than just spitting out the result by itself.
Overall thoughts: Good work! I tested your endpoints in Postman and Swagger and got the proper results from both platforms. Your code and your logic are good. I like that your variable names on the endpoints are prompting the user to enter the type of response you are looking for. If you added data validation and a little bit more formatting to your return statements to the user it would be great!
